- **Make sure to soak dirty dishes/caps in the sink**
- **Scrub dishes prior to using dishwasher**

### Dishwasher (in Autoclave room)
(\~35mins)

1.  Remove tape from glassware as much as possible before autoclaving

2.  Place bottles on metal pegs and caps/flatware (ie: stir sticks) in

    foil 2-3 times and cover the opening

3.  Place autoclave tape on foil or where the cap meets the bottle

4.  Open the door & lock the trolley into place before using autoclaves
    gloves to pull the cart onto the trolley

    in) and tips in cabinets by gloves

### Disposing of/Autoclaving Bio-waste (trash)
(\~90 mins)

    2.  Twist the bag and use colored tape to tape around the twist
        several times. Then tape down onto the bag.

        that it doesn’t spill over the sides
