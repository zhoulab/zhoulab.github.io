## Abstract

Inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes can give rise to distinct mononuclear myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Mo-MDSC), immature macrophages, M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), M1-like TAMs or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). This protocol describes a method to assess the fate and recruitment of inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes in the tumor microenvironment.

## Materials and Reagents

## Equipment

## Procedure

1. Remove medium and add 2ml PBS 1X/1mM PMSF to each plate and scrape cells at room temperature (RT). Pool together the cells from two plates and centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes at RT;
1. Wash cell pellet with 20ml PBS1X/1mM PMSF at RT and centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Repeat this step 3 times;
1. Resuspend pellet in 20ml PBS1X/1mM PMSF;
1. Add disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) to a final concentration of 2mM and mix immediately. DSG is prepared as a 0.5M stock solution in DMSO (note 1);
1. Incubate for 45 minutes at RT on a rotating wheel at medium speed (8-10 rpm);
1. At the end of fixation, centrifuge the sample at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at RT;
1. Wash cell pellet with 20ml PBS1X/1mM PMSF at RT and centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Repeat this step 3 times;
1. Resuspend pellet in 20ml PBS1X/1mM PMSF;
1. Add 540µl of 37% formaldehyde and mix immediately. Incubate samples on a rotating wheel for 15 minutes at RT;
1. Add 1ml glycine from a 2.5M stock solution and mix immediately. Incubate on a rotating wheel for 10 minutes at RT (note 2);
1. Centrifuge samples at 1500 rpm for 4 minutes in cold centrifuge, then keep samples on ice;
1. Remove the supernatant and wash pellet 3 times with 10ml ice-cold PBS1X/1mM PMSF. After each washing centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C;
1. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 500µl ice-cold Cell Lysis Buffer. Pipette up and down 10-20 times, then incubate on ice for 10 minutes;
1. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C;
1. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 600µl ice-cold RIPA Buffer. Pipette up and down 10-20 times, then incubate on ice for 10 minutes;
1. Sonication of cross-linked cells is performed in two distinct steps. First, cells are sonicated with a Branson digital Sonifier 2 times for 30 seconds at 40% setting. Next, cell samples are further sonicated with the Diogene Bioruptor for 20 minutes at a full power in a tank filled with ice/water in order to keep cell samples at low temperature during sonication (note 3);
1. Centrifuge samples at 14000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C;
1. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and pre-clear lysate by incubating it with 50µl of Immobilized Protein A (Pierce) for 15 minutes in the cold room at constant rotation;
1. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C;
1. Take the supernatant, after having saved 50µl aliquot for preparation of Input DNA, and add 5µg of specific antibody;
1. Rotate the sample O/N in the cold room;
1. Add 50µl of Immobilized Protein A (Pierce) (prepared as described in note 4), and incubate by constant rotation for 30 minutes at room temperature;
1. Centrifuge the sample at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature;
1. Remove the supernatant and proceed to wash the beads. For each wash, incubate the sample by constant rotation for 3 minutes at room temperature and the centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes at RT;
1. Wash 4 times with 1ml RIPA Buffer + Complete protease inhibitors (Roche);
1. Wash 4 times with 1ml Washing buffer + Complete protease inhibitors (Roche);
1. Wash 2 times with 1ml TE buffer + Complete protease inhibitors (Roche);
1. Remove the supernatant and add 200µl TE buffer to the beads. Add 10µg RNAse A and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes. RNAse was prepared as a 1mg/ml stock solution in TE;
1. Add 50µl Proteinase K Buffer 5X and 6µl Proteinase K (19mg/ml). Then, incubate at 65°C in a shaker at 950 rpm for 6 hours;
1. Centrifuge at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, then transfer the supernatant (250µl) to a new tube;
1. Extract once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol;
1. Recover the aqueous phase (200µl) and transfer to a new tube. Add 100µl TE buffer to the remaining phenol/chloroform fraction and re-extract DNA. Recover the aqueous phase and add it to the previous one;
1. Extract the recovered aqueous phase once with chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol and transfer to a new tube;
1. Add 1µl glycogen (glycogen is 20mg/ml stock solution), 10µg Salmon Sperm DNA, 1/10 volumes Na-acetate 3M pH 5.2, and 2.5 volumes of cold 100% ethanol;
1. Vortex and precipitate at -80°C for 40 minutes;
1. Centrifuge at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C;
1. Remove the supernatant and wash pellet with 200µl of cold 70% ethanol;
1. Resuspend IP-DNA and INPUT samples in 50-100µl 10mM TrisHCl pH 8;
1. Use 2-4µl of IP-DNA and 2µl of Input DNA for Real Time PCR analysis.
